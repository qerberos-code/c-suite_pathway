### Creating Admin Users
To create an admin user, you can modify the database directly or add this code temporarily to `app.py`:

```python
# Add this after db.create_all() in the main block
with app.app_context():
    # Create an admin user
    admin_user = User(
        first_name='Admin',
        last_name='User',
        email='admin@example.com',
        password_hash=generate_password_hash('password123'),
        is_verified=True,
        is_admin=True
    )
    db.session.add(admin_user)
    db.session.commit()
```
